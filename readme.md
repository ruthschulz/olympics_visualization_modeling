# Data Visualization and Modeling: Olympic history

In this notebook, I practiced the techniques that I learnt during the Udemy course Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla (Pierian Data International).

I found an interesting looking Kaggle dataset: 120 years of Olympic history

From the description on Kaggle: "This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. I scraped this data from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018."

Things that I chose to explore in this dataset:
- changes in participation over time M/F, Team, Age, Sport
- predictor of sport given physical features (Sex, Age, Weight, Height) -> what sport should you do, given your physical features
